# Student Stress Level Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the stress levels of students using quantum-inspired machine learning techniques. The system utilizes a hybrid approach, combining classical machine learning algorithms with quantum circuitry to make predictions based on various factors contributing to stress levels.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: The dataset containing various attributes related to student stress levels is preprocessed to remove irrelevant features and handle missing values.
- Visualization: Descriptive statistics and visualizations are provided to understand the distribution of data and its characteristics.
- Machine Learning: Classical machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data to predict stress levels.
- Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning: Quantum circuits are employed to classify stress levels, providing a novel approach to prediction.
- User Interaction: Users can input their own attributes to receive a prediction of their stress level.
